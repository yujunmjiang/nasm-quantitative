## Project 01 - Air and Space Materials

The Smithsonian's [National Air and Space Museum (NASM)](https://airandspace.si.edu/) maintains the world's largest and most significant [collection](https://airandspace.si.edu/node/60201) of aviation and space artifacts, encompassing all aspects of human flight, as well as related works of art and archival materials. It operates two landmark facilities that, together, welcome more than eight million visitors a year, making it the most visited museum in the country. It also is home to the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies.

#### Data

In this project, I will foucus on the relations between different variables such us the aircraft's first service year, materials, origin of country, etc. The data visualization should use a quantitative method to translate the metadata from number and text into a visual system.

The metadata will be fetched from the [Smithsonian Institution Open Access API](http://edan.si.edu/openaccess/apidocs/) and [here](https://thisismattmiller.com/post/smithsonian-open-access-data-release/) is some information about their data release. However, the data is not a completed version as the NASM's website shows, so I have to add the missing parts manually.

#### Design

The Museum's two buildings house thousands of artifacts showcased in exhibitions on aviation, space exploration, and planetary science. At both of its locations, the Museum presents programs, educational activities, lectures, and performances that reflect the American spirit, and the innovation, courage, and optimism that have led to triumphs in the history, science and technology of flight. At the [Museum in Washington, DC](https://airandspace.si.edu/museum-dc), which opened in 1976 and is located in the heart of the Smithsonian complex in Washington, DC, some of the most awe-inspiring icons of flight are on display. The [Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center](https://airandspace.si.edu/udvar-hazy-center), located near Washington Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Virginia, is a massive structure with open, hangar-like settings that accommodate large aircraft and spacecraft, as well as entire collections of aviation and space artifacts.

For the visual disign, I referenced the architectural elements in the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center becuase people can see most aircraft and spacecraft in there. I believe there should be some connections beteewn the museum's collection and architecture. Therefore, I have analyzed the museum's strcture, re-combined them with my dataset, and applied it into the final visualization.

Considering the font choice, I think [IBM Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono) is a better option than [Courier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_(typeface)) even both of them are created for IBM's typewriters. The newer version can express a sense of the military element and technological development.

As you can see, the shape of visualization is referenced from the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center and it seems like a bird view of airplanes. Then, I used three different color palettes to visualize the aircraft's first service year, materials, and origin of country. The difference is the change of opacity will only be applied to visualize the total service time and it was inspired by aircraft's coatings are faded when time goes by. Each meterial has been assigned with an unique color to help people understand what are aircraft's compositions base on our common understanding. And the color of different countries are matched with they national flags. The name of Digicraft is a combination of words "digitalize" and "aircraft". The goal is to make a simple design but use the most easily understandable visual language to tell a story.
